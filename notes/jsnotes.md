# JS Notes

- **Functions**:
  Javascript functions are first class functions

  - **When to use `const` v. `function`**:
    Function statements are hoisted to the top of the lexical scope.
    Const are blocked scoped and and stops full hoisting and ensures it cannot be re-declared.
    A const deceleration can fail silently and can be lost while a function can be found in your stack trace.

## Keyword

- Lexical Scope: determines where and when the variable or function can be accessed.
